# flw2 = '''Hey hope thing have been well, I am bulk sending a follow-up message just because after checking chat messages I saw some of you didnt submit the assignment directly, but instead just pasted it in the chat. (https://chat.whatsapp.com/CJ2a8OPNCWZFgc7TtNYaD8)

# (There are too many auto-replies in the chat for me to account for which is why I made this group chat, where I asked people to send the video demo)

# THE MAIN THING PEOPLE DID WRONG IS HARD CODING, RATHER THAN CODING ANY FUNCTIONS YOU SHOULD BE ASKING CHATGPT TO WRITE THE CODE BASED ON ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE TASK.

# By the way theres a video for the assignment if you wanted a clearer guide.
# https://www.loom.com/share/4af8cb1564974b21a3893080c088d836

# We do have a 3 LAKH bonus prize if anyone completes all 7 sample tests as shown here, with quicker speed than their demo's (they didnt have GPT3.5 at the time) on top of the 30LPA+ Yearly Position

# I also did a deeper dive into the future of the software we are building you can see here if you want to fully wrap your head around what that job will look like after:
# https://www.loom.com/share/f2f34d18239043a4bb9503d9cf43ef36

# Then, here's a video that we had as a team meeting with some new recruits (even more insights and talk about the future of what we are building and releasing)
